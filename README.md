🛡️ Cybersecurity: Suspicious Web Threat Interactions

A cybersecurity-focused project that analyzes and detects suspicious web interactions such as phishing attempts, malicious URLs, abnormal HTTP requests, and potential intrusion activities using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL).

🚀 Features

Detects and classifies suspicious web interactions (malicious requests, phishing URLs, abnormal user behavior).

Extracts network and URL-based features (length, entropy, keywords, request headers, user-agent anomalies).

Implements ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and DL models (ANN, CNN, LSTM).

Provides insights into attack patterns (SQL Injection, XSS, phishing redirections).

Can be integrated into web servers, firewalls, or SIEM systems for real-time monitoring.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.x

Scikit-learn for ML models

TensorFlow / Keras for DL models

Pandas, NumPy for data processing

Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization

Regex & NLP for text-based feature extraction
🎯 Future Improvements

Real-time integration with Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

Deploy as a browser extension or web proxy filter.

Use transformer-based models (BERT, DistilBERT) for better phishing detection.

Develop a dashboard for threat monitoring & visualization.
